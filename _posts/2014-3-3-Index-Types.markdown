There are two types of index available, <a href="simple_index.html" target="_blank">Simple</a> and <a href="hierarchical_index.html" target="_blank">Hierarchical</a> . You cannot use both type at the same time, atleast not right now. If you intend to use the 'Simple' style you should not include tags in ANY of your article's YAML front-matter. Likewise, if you intend to use 'Hierarchical' style, you should include one and only one tag in EVERY article's YAML front-matter. 'tags' will be used to classify posts unit-wise. Posts having same tag will fall under same unit inside the index.
