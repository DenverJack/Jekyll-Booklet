This project makes use of Jekyll and layouts from Codrops. So here are their Licensing policies and Terms of Use <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/blob/master/LICENSE" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> and <a href="http://tympanus.net/codrops/licensing/" target="_blank">Codrops</a>.

If you like this project or find it useful in some way or other, let me know @ChintanGhate. This project is not yet perfect, as I am not that well versed in JS or CSS, so if you would like to improve it, fork it on github and send pull requests to make it better.

Thank You.
